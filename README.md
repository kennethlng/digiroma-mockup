## Features

### Live Search

We wanted users to be able to search for products as they type and see results pop up in real-time. I used A timeout was included so that API requests were only sent after the user stopped typing for a brief duration. Otherwise, it resulted in a build-up of requests. For extra measure, axiosâ€™ Cancellation feature was used to cancel requests in the event of duplicate requests to the same endpoint.
